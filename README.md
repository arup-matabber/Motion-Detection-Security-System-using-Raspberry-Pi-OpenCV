# Motion-Detection-Security-System-using-Raspberry-Pi-OpenCV
This project implements a motion detection security system using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and GPIO-based alerts. It monitors live video feed, detects intrusions, triggers buzzer and LED alerts, captures timestamped images, and logs events, offering a cost-effective solution for homes, labs, offices, and IoT surveillance.
